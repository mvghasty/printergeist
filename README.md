# ¬¨‚Äø¬¨ smoly ‚òÖ

A command-line utility built in Python (`pycups`) to send files directly to your USB printer on Linux ‚Äî tested on **Fedora 41** with the **Epson L3250** (my personal printer and OS, btw), but with cross-platform dreams.

The project was born out of personal frustration: even after installing the correct drivers, communicating with my printer and actually sending print jobs was more painful than it should be. Printing documents became a bottleneck in my workflow. So I decided to build something fast, simple, and intuitive (and customizable!) to solve it once and for all ‚Äî and thus, **smoly** was born.

Besides just working (hopefully), it also:
- üíÖ Uses `rich` to make your terminal a beautiful place.
- üîç Displays detailed technical info about the print job (format, color, size, status, etc.).
- üß† Features custom error messages and feedback with colorful **ASCII-style emojis** to make the experience fun and friendly.
- üí° Fully hackable and extensible ‚Äî feel free to play with the visuals or extend the logic.

## REQUIREMENTS

To run **smoly** smoothly on your system, you'll need the following:

- Python 3.9 or newer
