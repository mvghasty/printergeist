# Define the absolute path to the main.py file of the Printergeist application.
# This path should point directly to where the actual entry-point Python script is located.
# Example: PATH_PGT="/home/user/projects/printergeist/src/main.py"
# This allows the shell script to locate and execute main.py no matter where the user runs this script from.
PATH_PGT="/home/mavic/Área de trabalho/printergeist/src/main.py"

# Execute the Python script using the system’s Python 3 interpreter.
# "$@" forwards all command-line arguments received by this shell script to the Python script.
# This means that arguments like filenames, flags, or options can be passed directly through.
