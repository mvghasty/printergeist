# Define the absolute path to the main.py file of the Printergeist application.
# This path should point directly to where the actual entry-point Python script is located.
# Example: MAIN_PATH="/home/user/projects/printergeist/src/main.py"
# This allows the shell script to locate and execute main.py no matter where the user runs this script from.
